script, data, results on my graduation paper

Description of the project: My graduation project is an analysis of the causal relationship between the percent of female director in the board and the firm's performance in terms of ROA. The target firms are those listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). During data collection, I noticed that there seemed to have a barrier for researchers to get related infomation despite the fact that all the infomation needed are available to the public through EDINET which is run by the FSA. The reality is that in order to get the infomation, researchers have to pay a large subscription fee to financial infomation providers. Therefore, I'd like to share the scriptsï¼Œ data, and results I gathered and used so that going forward if researchers facing similar dilemma of obtaining information they could have a reference.

The files will be organized as following:
1. data collection
2. data cleaning
3. data analysis
